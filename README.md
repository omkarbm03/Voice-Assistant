# Voice-Assistant

Integrating Intelligent Voice Assistants

Overview -->

This project presents a comprehensive design, implementation, and evaluation of a Python-based voice assistant system. The system integrates robust speech recognition, natural language processing, and task execution functionalities, enabling users to perform diverse actions through vocal directives. Notably, this system encompasses multilingual capabilities, accommodating interactions in both English and Hindi languages, enhancing accessibility and inclusivity.

Features -->

Speech recognition for accurate interpretation of user commands.

Multilingual support for interactions in both English and Hindi languages.

Integration with third-party platforms such as Wikipedia and Instagram.

User authentication feature for authorized access and secure interactions.

Evaluation of performance metrics including speech recognition accuracy and task execution response times.
